# NPS Data Analysis and Visualization
## An Exploratory Data Analysis of the Make School 2017 Program

### Main Questions:
1. Should Make School offer VR as a track once more?
2. Do you need to love your classes in Make School to succeed?

### Summary of Findings:
1. Despite being only a small portion of the 2017 Make School program, VR displayed some of the highest NPS scores out of all students in the program. This trend holds both against students in the other individual tracks, as well as compared to all non-VR Make School students.
2. While other Make School track offerings gained more popularity amongst students, they had a much larger variance in the numbers of students responding the NPS survey. On the other hand, VR students were much more consistent in providing feedback to Make School.
3. The previous two points suggests that it may be advantageous for Make School to bring back the VR track. When it was implemented in the past, students in the VR track had extremely positive NPS feedback for Make School, both in terms of their actual scores, as well as student participation in the feedback surveys.
4. There is no strong conditional probability between NPS score and being comfortable with the pace of classes in students of the 2017 Make School program. The promoters had only a slighty increased probability of finding the classes easy as opposed to the passive and detractor groups, an even then all three probabilities decreased over the course of the program. This may suggest that "loving what you do" did not do much to help student success in Make School 2017.
